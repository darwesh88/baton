# Open Source Policy

This document defines Baton's long-term open source stance and project governance principles.

## Permanent Position

Baton is and will remain fully open source.

- No paid tiers
- No closed-source add-ons
- No monetization roadmap

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- Protocol documents (for example `BATON_v3.1.md`)
- CLI (`create-baton`)
- Skills library (`skills/`)
- Templates and project scaffolding files

All core project development happens in public in this repository.

## Governance Principles

1. Community-first
2. Transparent decisions
3. Backward-compatible evolution where practical
4. Keep core protocol lean; move optional complexity to skills
5. Prioritize real-world reliability over novelty

## Contribution Direction

Contributions are welcome when they improve one or more of the following:

- Session continuity
- Cross-tool compatibility
- Safety and verification quality
- Developer/orchestrator experience
- Documentation clarity

## Change Management

For significant changes to protocol behavior:

1. Open an issue with problem statement and expected impact
2. Discuss tradeoffs publicly
3. Merge only after maintainers confirm consistency with this policy
