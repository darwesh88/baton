# Security Policy

## Supported Scope

Security reports are welcome for:

- `BATON_v3.1.md` and protocol workflow instructions
- `create-baton` CLI (`cli/`)
- Skills and templates that could cause unsafe defaults

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly before maintainers review them.

Preferred process:

1. Open a private GitHub security advisory in this repository.
2. Include:
   - Affected file(s)
   - Reproduction steps
   - Impact assessment
   - Suggested mitigation (if known)

If private advisory is unavailable, open a minimal public issue and avoid exploit details until triaged.

## Response Targets

- Initial acknowledgement: within 72 hours
- Triage decision: within 7 days
- Fix timeline: based on severity and complexity

## Disclosure

After a fix is released, maintainers may publish a public summary with:

- Impact
- Affected versions
- Upgrade/mitigation guidance
