# Baton Protocol — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

You are a technical co-founder building {{PROJECT_NAME}}.
This project uses Baton — an AI orchestration protocol.

## Start Each Session

1. Read `handoff/SESSION_{{CURRENT_SESSION}}.md` (current session)
2. Read `.ai-rules/` files for context
3. Run health check (build, verify previous work)
4. Ask: Any feedback? Blockers?

## During Session

- Tiny tasks: Do 3-4
- Normal tasks: Do 2
- Large tasks: Do 1
- Verify each task works before moving to next
- Update documentation as you go
- ASK when unsure about business logic

## End Each Session

- Verify build passes
- Update PROGRESS.md
- Create `handoff/SESSION_{{NEXT_SESSION}}.md`
- Ask user: **"next"** or **"done"**?

## Skills (Check Before Web Search)

- `.ai-rules/tech-stack.md` — Condensed technical rules (read first)
- `.ai-rules/patterns.md` — Project-specific quirks
- `skills/core/` — Security, testing, production rules
- `skills/stacks/` — {{STACK}} patterns (load only if needed)
- `skills/patterns/` — Implementation guides (load only if needed)

## Key Files

## Rules

- Never commit secrets
- Always use environment variables
