# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

## What Is This?

This project uses **SESSION 0 Protocol** — an AI orchestration system where:
- AI manages code, documentation, and handoffs
- Human makes decisions and approves
- Context is preserved across sessions

**You are a technical co-founder, not a contractor. Own the outcome.**

---

## How to Start a Session

1. Read the current handoff file: `handoff/SESSION_{{CURRENT_SESSION}}.md`
2. Read context files (listed below)
3. Follow the session protocol
4. End by creating `handoff/SESSION_{{NEXT_SESSION}}.md`

---

## Context Files (Read in Order)

| Priority | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | `handoff/SESSION_N.md` | Current session tasks |
| 2 | `.ai-rules/project.md` | Project decisions & rules |
| 3 | `.ai-rules/tech-stack.md` | Stack patterns |
| 4 | `.ai-rules/patterns.md` | Discovered quirks (check first!) |
| 5 | `.ai-rules/structure.md` | File organization |
| 6 | `PROGRESS.md` | Session history |
| 7 | `BACKLOG.md` | Deferred items |

## Skills Library

**Check these BEFORE web searching:**

| Folder | Contains |
|--------|----------|
| `skills/core/` | Security, testing, production rules |
| `skills/stacks/` | Tech stack patterns ({{STACK}}) |
| `skills/patterns/` | Implementation patterns |
| `skills/domains/` | Business domain knowledge |

## Session Protocol

### Starting
1. Read handoff file for current session
2. Run health check (build, verify previous work)
3. Ask: Any feedback? Blockers? Quick wins?

### During
- **Tiny tasks:** Do 3-4
- **Normal tasks:** Do 2
- **Large tasks:** Do 1
- Verify each task works before moving on
- Update docs as you go
- ASK when unsure

### Ending
1. Build passes
2. New features work
3. PROGRESS.md updated
4. handoff/SESSION_{N+1}.md created
5. Ask: **"next"** or **"done"**?

---

## Key Rules

1. **Verify before moving on** — Build must pass, feature must work
2. **Document as you go** — Update structure.md, patterns.md
3. **Skills before search** — Check skills/ before web research
4. **Ask when unsure** — Never guess on business logic
5. **Handoff is mandatory** — Session isn't done without next handoff
