## Pull Request Checklist

- Keep changes focused.
- Update docs when behavior changes.

- Include before/after examples when possible.

## Skill Contributions

Skills must use `SKILL.md` format and stay practical.

- Add only high-signal guidance.
- Prefer concrete patterns over generic advice.
- Keep stack/domain specificity inside skills, not core protocol.

## Commit and Release Notes
